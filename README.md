# Employee-Prediction
This project aims to analyze employee data, identify key drivers of attrition, and build predictive models to support proactive decision-making in workforce management.

# Approach

1. Data Preprocessing
    1.1 Drop Unnecessary Columns
    1.2 Handle Missing Values
    1.3 Convert categorical variables to numeric using label encoding for categorical features using LabelEncoder
    1.4 Normalize the data for DailyRate MonthlyIncome MonthlyRate
2. Write the preprocessed data to a new CSV file
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
     3.1 Distribution of Attrition
     3.2 Correlation Heatmap
     3.3 Distribution of Age
     3.4 Boxplot of Monthly Income by Job Level
     3.5 Attrition by Gender
4. Feature Selection
5. Model Training
     5.1 Split the data into training and testing sets
     5.2 Initialize the model
     5.3 Train the model
     5.4 Make predictions
     5.5 Evaluate the model
     5.6 Feature Importance
     5.7 Save the Model
6. Load the Model
7. AUC-ROC
8. Confusion Matrix
